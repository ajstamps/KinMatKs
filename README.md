# KinMatKs
KinMatKs is my attempt at making a vehicle dynamics Kinematics Simulation program.

![A picture of the software running](https://github.com/ajstamps/KinMatKs/blob/main/ProgStart.png?raw=true)

Current functionality includes:

* Squat - Press S to make the vehicle squat (not currently working, math is hard)

* Bump - Press B to make the vehicle bump (just barely working)

* Fully* adjustable suspension points, inboard and outboard (Fully meaning it follows traditional double wishbone suspension design)

* Move around the model. This one I'm really proud of, cause quaternions kinda suck.

* Does 'quit' count? - Press Q to quit the program

* Perspective - Very gimmicky, press P to cause a change in perspective. Doesn't look better, but it's another button to press.

* Lighting - Press L to toggle lighting. Defaults to 'on' since that looks better IMO, but can be turned off if it works for you

# TODO, but in no order of importance

* Fix Squat functionality

* Add second half to vehicle (what good is only two wheels?)

* Add gravity (kinda useless without the ever-constant force that all cars experience)

* Add center of mass (kinda necessary for gravity to work correctly)

* Add in program parameter changing

* Add parameter saving

* Add data replay (Bad idea, many headaches, wicked cool)
